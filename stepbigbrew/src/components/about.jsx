                            Kirsten, Dominique, and Quian, three friends with a shared passion for coffee and web development, were nearing the end of their web development course. For their final project, they brainstormed ideas that combined their interests.
                            <br /><br />
                            They decided to create StepBIGBREW, an online coffee shop concept. Their goal was to build a website that not only showcased their web development skills but also provided a virtual space for coffee enthusiasts to connect and enjoy their favorite brews.
                            <br /><br />
                            Together, they collaborated on designing the website, ensuring it was user-friendly and visually appealing, handling the coding aspect, making sure all functionalities worked seamlessly, and taking charge of promoting StepBIGBREW on social media platforms.
                            <br /><br />
                            Their project aimed to bring people together over a shared love for coffee, even in the digital realm. With their combined efforts, they successfully launched StepBIGBREW, offering an inviting online space where anyone could experience the joy of a coffee break from the comfort of their own home.
