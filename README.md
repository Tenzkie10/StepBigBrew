# StepBigBrew

A group of students from Mariano Marcos State University developed an web application. Kirsten, Dominique, and Quian, three friends with a shared passion for coffee and web development, were nearing the end of their web development course. For their final project, they brainstormed ideas that combined their interests.

They decided to create StepBIGBREW, an online coffee shop concept. Their goal was to build a website that not only showcased their web development skills but also provided a virtual space for coffee enthusiasts to connect and enjoy their favorite brews.

Together, they collaborated on designing the website, ensuring it was user-friendly and visually appealing, handling the coding aspect, making sure all functionalities worked seamlessly, and taking charge of promoting StepBIGBREW on social media platforms.

Their project aimed to bring people together over a shared love for coffee, even in the digital realm. With their combined efforts, they successfully launched StepBIGBREW, offering an inviting online space where anyone could experience the joy of a coffee break from the comfort of their own home.
